Assumptions:
Assumption 1 char variables only occur in assignment operations or function parameters/arguments
Assumption 2 only int variables can do boolean operations
Assumption 3 only int and float variables can do arithmetic operations
Assumption 4 no nested function definitions
Assumption 5 field names in struct definitions are unique (in any scope), i.e., the names of struct fields, and variables never overlap
Assumption 6 there is only the global scope, i.e., all variable names are unique
Assumption 7 using named equivalence to determine whether two struct types are equivalent
